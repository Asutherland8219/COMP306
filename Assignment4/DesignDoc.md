Design doc for the Alice and Wonderland Text Based Game 

The overall structure is that of an intro, three checkpoint phases and a finale. The purpose of the checkpoints is that each pathway or scenario will have 
4 possible instances. Each instance is broken down as follows: 
- Happy Path (The best outcome for the block)
- Sad Path (The worst outcome, BUT still a path forward)
- Sub-optimal path ( A path with a mixture of outcomes, some happy some sad)
- Death (The character, Alice, dies and the user is forced to return to the checkpoint)

** Death will not be very violent or descriptive. In some instances it may actually be 
the incapacitation of the character that results in them returning to the checkpoint**

The intro section will have one path, think of it like a tutorial. It is a preset path that sets up the story and regardless of decision, the final outcome of the intro
will be the same. 

Checkpoint 1 introduces more decisions and outcomes as well as the ability to die. 

Checkpoint 2, will follow a similar structure but also allow some saving grace. If they took a bad path or sub-optimal path
they will have the ability to improve their current standing. 

The outcome of checkpoint 2 will decide the options in checkpoint 3. 

Checkpoint 3 will have no death component and will always make sure to move towards the ending

The finale, or ending, will have no ability to retcon or fix previous decisions. This block is predetermined 
by the previous blocks. As noted, there will be 4 outcomes available for the user. Basically written as:
- Bad ending (Death)
  - Not really "Death" but an ending that is non satisfactory to the goal
- Sad ending
- Sub optimal - basically just a normal ending, actions did nothing
- Happy ending 

________________________________________________________

The story is frame as the user being Alice. Alice stumbles into a magical forest while out for a walk foraging. Upon entering the forest 
she falls down a black hole into Wonderland. 

Her goal, at the beginning of the game, is to escape Wonderland and return to her world. 
She has no idea where to go but can see in the distance a LARGE beautiful castle. Perhaps they could be of assistance...
