 DOCUMENTATION

 Program Purpose:
	Interact with the Queen, hope to get an answer or a route out of here.


 Classes (functions):
	- Chapter3(Character)
        Accepts the previously edited character in the Chapter 2 function, modifies it and returns it for subsequent chapter calls.

This section is the first instance of where the user has the option to choose a path. I will describe the paths here and the
 overarching question being asked here. The path options are:
 1. duchess_house_breaker -> How do you want to deal with the Duchess at her house.
 2. duchess_intro_breaker -> How do you want to interact with the Duchess immediately after rescuing her.
